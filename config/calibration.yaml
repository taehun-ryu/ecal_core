# Windowing (adaptive):
# - Start each window with length = window_sec.
# - If collected events < min_events and current window_len < max_window_sec,
#   the window is extended (in steps of window_sec) up to max_window_sec.
# - If collected events >= max_events, the window is cut early at that time.
# - To enforce a fixed window length, set:
#     window_sec = min_window_sec = max_window_sec (e.g., 0.01)
